/*
DOM Traversal
The <html> element is the parent of <body> and an ancestor of everything below it.
The <body> element is the parent of the <h1> and <a> elements.
The <h1> and <a> elements are child elements of the <body> element and descendants of <html>.
The <h1> and <a> elements are siblings (they share the same parent).

Summary
An ancestor is a parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on.
A descendant is a child, grandchild, great-grandchild, and so on.
Siblings share the same parent.


Understanding the relationship between the DOM elements is important to be able to traverse the DOM correctly.
